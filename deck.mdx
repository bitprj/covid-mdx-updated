## Add the Line Graph

- After passing the COVID-19 time series data, we can now create our time series model.
- To excute this, we would use JavaScript's wobderful library, Chart.js, to create this model.
- With this library on our side, the first step would be to create a canvas by using this HTML command within the template variable
  `<canvas id="myChart"></canvas>`.
- Now that we have our canvas, we can now use the Chart.js library through calling this JavaScript command above the HTML one
  to initialize Chart.js library, `<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/chart.js@2.8.0"></script>`.
- After that, we can write the JavaScript code written below between the two `<script>` parameters to form the body that passes the       dates and data values of our dataset.
- Now that we have completed the steps, we can run the code through the send button and after we click the visualize button, we have
  finally created our time series model!

- We can see here that the cases for COVID-19 have been stagnet throughout January and February, but then they start to increase in       March. This means that as time goes on after March, the number of COVID-19 cases increase, meaning the disease is starting to spread
  much throughout the US during this time.
