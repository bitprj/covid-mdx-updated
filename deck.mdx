## Add the Line Graph

* After passing the COVID-19 time series data, we can now create our time series model.
* To excute this, we would use JavaScript's wobderful library, Chart.js, to create this model.
* With this library on our side, the first step would be to create a canvas by using this HTML command within the template variable
  `<canvas id="myChart"></canvas>`.
* Now that we have our canvas, we can now use the Chart.js library through calling this JavaScript command above the HTML one
  to initialize Chart.js library, `<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/chart.js@2.8.0"></script>`.
* After that, we can write the JavaScript code written below between the two `<script>` parameters to form the body that passes the       dates and data values of our dataset.

* Now that we have completed the steps, we can run the code through the send button and after we click the visualize button, we have
  finally created our time series model!

* We can see here that the cases for COVID-19 have been stagnet throughout January and February, but then they start to increase in        March. This means that as time goes on after March, the number of COVID-19 cases increase, meaning the disease is starting to spread
   much throughout the US during this time.

## Show Time Series for another country

* Now that you've seen the time series of COVID-19 from the US, you're probably thinking, "How can we growth of COVID-19 cases from
  other countries?"
* Well, you're in luck! Notice how on the GET search bar, we already have the API key for our 
  dataset, `https://covidapi.info/api/v1/country/USA`, but `USA` value after `/country/` represents the specfic country that we selected 
  to show the time series for.
* Now what you can do is simply change that parameter for another country. Let's say we want to look at the growth of COVID-19 cases in 
  China. China's value is known as `CHN`. So you would would replace `USA` with `CHN` after the `/country/` parameter like so
  `https://covidapi.info/api/v1/country/CHN`.
* Once that's completed you, can search for it on the API key, click the send button, click the visualize button to create the model 
  and voila! You have created the Time Series model for China.

## Show Time Series for another Value

* Now you've seen how to get a time series just for one country, but what if you wanted to find the level of impact throughout the
  entire world?
* Well you can now do that through editing the API key for the GET search bar. 
* Remember when we made a time series just for China using the API call `https://covidapi.info/api/v1/country/CHN`? Well what you can
  do is change the positional arguments `/country/` and `CHN` because the `/country/` parameter specifies justr for a country and `CHN`
  refers only to the specific country, China.
* Now to actually change the parameters, you should replace `/country/` with `/global/` because this would allow the API key tp realise
  that we want to collect the COVID-19 cases everywhere rather than one place and after `/global/` I would put `count` because this
  would specify the total count for every country.
* Your API key on the GET search bar will look like this, `https://covidapi.info/api/v1/global/count`, and once you hit send and the
  visualize buttons, just like that, you created another time series model for COVID-19 cases for the entire world.

## Change of Variables for Data Types

* We have seen given variables within our dataset to create time series models, but what would happen if we change the variable's
  names? Let's find out.
* When we go to pre-request script, this is where we can initialize our variables to anything that we please. Let's say that we
  wanted to name our variable "ISO" from the data from China. We would then use the `pm.variables.set()` function call to initialize
  the variable name and the first parameter will be the name we want to define (`ISO`) and the second parameter will store all of the
  data from the previous variable (`CHN`). The function call will look like this, `pm.variables.set("ISO", "CHN");`.
* Now you can click the send button to run the code for it and click visualize and you'll notice two things when you run this time 
  series: the graph looks exactly the same and the API key has a different variable after `/country/` 
  `https://covidapi.info/api/v1/country/{{ISO}}`. That is because the only thing we have redefined was China's variable name
  but everything else remains the same.
