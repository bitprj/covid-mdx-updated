## Add the Line Graph

- After passing the COVID-19 time series data, we can now create our time series model.
- To excute this, we would use JavaScript's wobderful library, Chart.js, to create this model.
- With this library on our side, the first step would be to create a canvas by using this HTML command within the template variable
  `<canvas id="myChart"></canvas>`.
- Now that we have our canvas, we can now use the Chart.js library through calling this JavaScript command above the HTML one
  to initialize Chart.js library, `<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/chart.js@2.8.0"></script>`.
- After that, we can write the JavaScript code written below between the two `<script>` parameters to form the body that passes the       dates and data values of our dataset.
- Now that we have completed the steps, we can run the code through the send button and after we click the visualize button, we have
  finally created our time series model!

- We can see here that the cases for COVID-19 have been stagnet throughout January and February, but then they start to increase in       March. This means that as time goes on after March, the number of COVID-19 cases increase, meaning the disease is starting to spread
  much throughout the US during this time.

## Show Time Series for another country

- Now that you've seen the time series of COVID-19 from the US, you're probably thinking, "How can we growth of COVID-19 cases from
  other countries?"
- Well, you're in luck! Notice how on the GET search bar, we already have the API key for our 
  dataset, `https://covidapi.info/api/v1/country/USA`, but `USA` value after `country\` represents the specfic country that we selected 
  to show the time series for.
- Now what you can do is simply change that parameter for another country. Let's say we want to look at the growth of COVID-19 cases in 
  China. China's value is known as `CHN`. So you would would replace `USA` with `CHN` after the `country\` parameter like so
  `https://covidapi.info/api/v1/country/CHN`.
- Once that's completed you, can search for it on the API key, click the send button, click the visualize button to create the model 
  and voila! You have created the Time Series model for China.
